== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this like Elementor for Gutenberg? =

Yes! Magical Blocks brings Elementor-style design controls to the native WordPress editor. You get Flexbox containers, responsive controls, and visual design panels – all without leaving Gutenberg.

= Does this plugin work with my theme? =

Yes! Magical Blocks works with any properly coded WordPress theme. It uses CSS variables that integrate seamlessly with modern themes like Twenty Twenty-Four, Astra, Kadence, and GeneratePress.

= Will this slow down my website? =

No. Magical Blocks uses on-demand asset loading, which means CSS and JavaScript files only load on pages that actually use the blocks. Pages without Magical Blocks have zero additional assets.

= How do I create multi-column layouts? =

Use the **Container Block** as a parent, then add **Inner Container Blocks** inside for each column. Set the parent container's Flex Direction to "Row" and adjust the width of each Inner Container. It works just like Elementor's sections and columns!

= Is it compatible with the Gutenberg plugin? =

Yes! We test with both WordPress core editor and the latest Gutenberg plugin to ensure compatibility.

= Can I use this with other block plugins? =

Absolutely. Magical Blocks is designed to complement other block plugins and won't conflict with them.

= Do you offer support? =

Yes! Free support is available through the WordPress.org support forums. Pro users get priority email support.

= Is there a Pro version? =

Yes! Magical Blocks Pro includes additional premium blocks, advanced features, and priority support. Visit our website for details.
